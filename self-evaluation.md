# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Fortunately I am familiar with a similar loop structure in Python so I just need to get more comfortable with the syntax.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I enjoyed it and I really like how easy the ruby docs are to search and comprehend.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I just need to get more familiar with the syntax and that will come with time.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Nothing right now but I have been using Slack to reach out and I find it very effective.
